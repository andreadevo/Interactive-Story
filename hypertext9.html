         <p>While partially listening to the professor talk in the background, I open up my <a href="https://facebook.com" target="apple"><b>Facebook</b></a> page. Scrolling through my newsfeed, I see an interesting article about the current election. In front of me, I see several other students reading similar articles. Looking around the classroom, I see most other students are also absorbed in some external content on their laptops. I wonder how many of these students, including myself, are fully absorbing todayâ€™s lesson. For the remainder of class, I try to pay attention and <a href="hypertext10.html"><b>take notes</b></a> without getting distracted by social media and news articles. Since this was my only class of the day, I debate whether I should <a href="hypertext12.html"><b>go on a run</b></a> or work on my <a href="hypertext11.html"><b>research paper</b></a> after lecture.</p>
